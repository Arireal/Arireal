# 👋 About Me

I work primarily as a **Python developer**, focused on building **practical, data-driven, and automation-oriented software**. My background in **UX/UI design** helps me approach problems with clarity, structure, and real user needs in mind.

Over time, I’ve transitioned from designing interfaces to building **complete systems** — from APIs and automation tools to full applications using **Python, SQL, and modern web technologies**. I enjoy working close to real-world problems, where software needs to be reliable, understandable, and actually used.

What drives me most is **problem-solving**. I like taking messy requirements, breaking them down into systems, and turning them into working solutions that balance **technical feasibility with human usability**.
